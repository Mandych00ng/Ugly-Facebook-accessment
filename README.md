# Facebook Sinatra Assessment
This is a question repo for testing your web server understanding related to Ruby. You'll be building a clone of Facebook, focusing on the backend server application. The goal of the assessment is to test your understanding of Active Record, Active Record Relationships and Associations, RESTFUL Routes and MVC through the use of the Sinatra framework, and thus the usage of Active Record, RESTFUL Routes and MVC is a **requirement**.

# Duration
5.5 hours. Cut off time is 4pm. *Of course you can order delivery/get someone to takeaway lunch to earn extra hour...

# What You Will Need to Do
1. First, `fork this repository` and `git clone` it to your local machine.
